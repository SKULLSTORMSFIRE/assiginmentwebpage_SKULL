Webpage things, its okay but not my best. Need to get the grade back for this still.//edit I have got the grade back for this and somehow I got 96% litrally my best mark this year so I must be ok then lol.

The server it sends requests to is the mmu university server and it receives requests not in the way you expect, it is pretending to be a server that takes requests but in reality its just looking for specific responses. Ik that does't make sense but what the point of it is that so students have a harder time messing with the server and also so they dont need to save the data sent, just need to check its correct.
